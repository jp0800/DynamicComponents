To return chunks of data in Flask without waiting for other processes to finish, you can use Flask streaming responses. This allows Flask to send data in parts (chunks) as it is generated instead of waiting for the entire processing to complete before sending a response.

How to Stream Data in Flask

Flask supports streaming by using generators (Python's yield). Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Basic Streaming Response

If you have a large dataset and want to send it in chunks, you can use Flaskâ€™s Response with a generator:

from flask import Flask, Response
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

def generate_data():
    for i in range(10):  # Simulate streaming 10 chunks
        yield f"Chunk {i}\n"
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate delay (e.g., data fetching)

@app.route("/stream")
def stream():
    return Response(generate_data(), content_type="text/plain")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, threaded=True)

How This Works

The generate_data() function yields chunks instead of returning everything at once.

Flask's Response sends each chunk as soon as it's ready.

The threaded=True in app.run() ensures that Flask can handle multiple requests concurrently.

2. Streaming JSON Chunks

If your frontend expects JSON data, send each chunk as a JSON object:

import json

def generate_json_data():
    for i in range(5):
        chunk = {"chunk_number": i, "message": f"Chunk {i} data"}
        yield json.dumps(chunk) + "\n"
        time.sleep(1)

@app.route("/json-stream")
def json_stream():
    return Response(generate_json_data(), content_type="application/json")

Frontend Example (Axios)

On the frontend, use Axios with responseType: 'stream':

axios.get('/json-stream', { responseType: 'stream' })
  .then(response => {
    response.data.on('data', chunk => {
      console.log("Received:", chunk);
    });
  });

3. Real-Time Database Query Streaming

If you're streaming database query results, use a cursor with yield:

import psycopg2

def stream_db_results():
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypass")
    cur = conn.cursor(name="streaming_cursor")  # Server-side cursor
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM large_table")

    for row in cur:
        yield json.dumps(row) + "\n"
    
    cur.close()
    conn.close()

@app.route("/db-stream")
def db_stream():
    return Response(stream_db_results(), content_type="application/json")

âœ… Pro: Avoids loading everything into memory.
âœ… Pro: Sends rows to frontend as soon as they are fetched.

Key Takeaways

âœ” Use yield with Response to stream data in Flask.
âœ” Works well with Axios or Fetch API on the frontend.
âœ” Ideal for logs, live updates, or large query results.
âœ” If using Gunicorn, add --threads=4 for better concurrency:

gunicorn -w 4 --threads 4 app:app
